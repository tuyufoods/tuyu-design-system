## About

This design system is a living, breathing document that contains all of the building blocks (React components, colors, icons, layout, etc) of the Tuyu projects. It aims to be single source of truth for developers and designers. Still a work in progress, always will be.

## Quick Links

## Guidelines

- [Design](./docs/design-guidelines.md)

## Tech stack

Building components

- 📚 [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org) for UI component development and auto-generated docs
- ⚛️ [React](https://reactjs.org/) declarative component-centric UI

Maintaining the system

- 📦 [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) for packaging and distribution
- 🚥 [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/automating-builds-and-tests/about-continuous-integration) Continuous integration

## Why

The Tuyu design system codifies existing UI components into a central, well-maintained repository. It is built to address having to paste the same components into multiple projects again and again. This simplifies building UI's with Tuyu's design patterns.
